This source is from *Jan 12, 2022* (not much has been done since then anyways). A lot of the code is just re-used from my old project and the aimbot is 1:1 pasted from moneybot. The movement code is also pasted from somewhere else but I'm not sure where from.

If you want semi-functional Lua, use the sol2 branch.
